(Removed reportWebVitals from index.js because it wasn't supported.
Added 'import React from "react"' in App.js because it's fricking confusing as heck why everyone else except me in the team doesn't have to do that and doesn't get any errors without that line & while that's the first thing I learnt in react that's necessary for a react app to run it's unfair man)
